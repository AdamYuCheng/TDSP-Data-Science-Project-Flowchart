# TDSP-Project-Flowchart

Team Data Science Process visualization flowchart.

TDSP is a really a good way to help every data scientist managing their data science project. It mix the concept from aglie, project management, software development and data science application development. The data science project management is similar to software project management but some of scope is different to traditional software development. Microsoft make a new structure of data science project management to help data science making a successful data science project and application.

Inspired by PMBOK process flowchart. I try to make a data science version and refer to TDSP from microsoft.

Hope this flowchart could help everyone feeling the scope of data science project.
